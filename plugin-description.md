This is a plugin that provides an easy way to copy to the clipboard the Prototype link to specific frames without having to switch into the Presentation mode.

How To Use:
Select layers and run the command 'Copy Prototype Link' and the link will be copied to the clipboard. When you first start the plugin in a File you will need to set the File Key on the Settings window manually. Just copy the whole File URL from the browser's address bar and paste it to the input field and the plugin will extract the File Key automatically. You also can paste only the File Key to the input field.

The File URL looks like:
https://figma.com/file/e9z7p5lisUPmRe9z7p5lisUPm/FileName

It is also possible to select and copy links to multiple selected Frames. In this case each link will be started with it's Frame name.

Your file share link is saved in your File safely. Itâ€™s not sent to any external server.
